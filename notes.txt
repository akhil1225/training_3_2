step 1: create a github account

step 2: create a repo in github

step 3: open terminal in vs code

step 4: init git in a local repo. Command : "git init"

step 5: configure user and email to local repo
	
	Commands: git config --global user.name ""
		  git config --global user.mail ""

step 6: add remote/cloud repo to local repo
	
	Command: git remote add origin <http path>

step 7: git pull origin <branch name> 

step 8: convert untracked files to tracked files
	Commands: git add .
		  git commit -m "<some message>"

step 9: check status. Command: git status

step 10: push to cloud repo
	Command: git push -u origin <branch name>


what is JavaScript?
	It is a object-based programming language, used to convert static pages into dynamic 	pages.
Datatypes in JS:
	primitive: number, string, boolean, undefined, null, big int, symbol
		=> immutable
		=> it can store single values

	non - primitive: class, object, array, function, map, set, 
		=> mutable
		=> can store multiple values

Strings: sequence of characters stored in double or single quotes or backticks(templete literals)
	ex: var username = "Allu Arjun";
	    let title = 'Super star'
		const net_worth = `123445`;
	
Boolean: true/false

Numbers: integers, float, decimal, exponential, etc...

Undefined: variable is initialized but never assigned a value.

Null: null is a absence of object or empty space
 q. what is the retuen type of "null" : object


Operators:
    Operators are special symbols which are used to perform operations on variables of number datatype
    ex: 2 + 2



1. Unary
2. Binary
3. Ternary (condn? ifTrue : ifFalse)

1.1 Arithmetic opetators
1.2 Assignment operators
1.3 Relational operators
1.4 Logical operators

1.1 Arithmetic :- which performs operations such as 
                            1. Addition
                            2. Substraction
                            3. Multiplication
                            4. Division
                            5. Modulus
                            6. Exponential
                            7. Increment
                            8. Decrement

1.2 Assignment operators :-     
                    1. =
                    2. += 
                    3. -=
                    4. %= 
                    5. /= 
                    6. *=
                    7 **=

1.3 Relational operators :-
                ==, ===, <=, >=, !=, <, >

1.4 Logical operators :-
                &&, ||, !
            && - both lhs and rhs should be true
            || - any one of lhs or rhs can be true
            ! - makes false if true and vice versa

**************************************************
if
if else
if eleif else
switch
Ternary

if : 
    when only one condition if there then, if can be used
    if block will only work for true statements

Functions:
    - Function is a building block of JavaScript
    - Function is a block of code which is used to execute specfic task
    - Function is non - primitive data type
    - Function can be reusable

    syntax: function func_name(optional parameters){
                //statements
            }
            function(arguments)
    
    - JS will not throw any errors if no parameters are defined and arguments are given when the function is called.

    Tpyes of functions:
    ******************
        1. Named function - function is having a name inviked with 
        2. Anonymous function - 
        3. Function expression
        4. Immediate invoke function expression
        5. Arrow function
        6. Higher order function - this is a function that recieves another function as arguments or values
        7. Callback function - callback function is a function which is passed as an argument to another function
explicit return :- explicitly we have to give a keyword called return 
explicit return is possible in both 

- no statements will be executed afte a return statement is written

- map() method in JS is a higher order function that accepts another callback function for iterating through a sequence.

Closure: 
    Closure is a memory created when functions are bundled together or nested each other by giving accessibility 

Arrays:
*******
    

JSON :-
********
 - JSON stands for JavaScript Object Notation
 - it is a javascript technique used to transfer data from client to server and from server to client
 JS object:
 **********
    let a = {
        name : "value",
        age : 25
    }
 JSON object:
 ***********
 {
    "name" : "value",
    "age" : 25
 }

JSON methods:-
**************
    1. JSON.stringify() - used to convert js object to JSON object.
    2. JSON.parse() - used to convert JSON object to js object

Asynchronous in Javascript:-
****************************
    - to perform multiple tasks at the same time
    
    1. setTimeout() - it is a web api used to perform async opeations with certain timeouts
       syntax:  setTimeout(callbackfunc, timeout)

    2. setInterval() - it is a web api to perform async operations at every time interval operation.

    3. promise - it is an object which represents eventual completion or failures of an async operation.
            states of promise : 
                1. pending state
                2. fulfilled state
                3. rejected state
            syntax: let x = new Promise((resolve, reject)=> {});
            
            - to execute the promise, we have instance methods:
                1. then() - it isused to execute success or fulfilled state results
                2. catch() - it is used to execute rejected state results.
                3. finally() - once promise is settled, it will print the 


    4. async & await
        async - this keyword converts synchronous functions into an asynchronous and starts the promise

        await - this keyword makes the functionto wait till the promise completes.

        note - await keyword is alwaysused with the async keyword.



Note - Javascript, by default is Synchronous(single threaded)

CREATE - POST
READ - GET
UPDATE - PUT
DELETE - DELETE

Document Object Model:-
----------------------
    -DOM is a web api used to manipulate the html content.
    -DOM is used to add, remove, update the content in the html document.

DOM Methods:-
-------------
    1. document.getElementById(""); - used to select an html element based on its ID attribute value.
                                    - with ID attribute, we can select only one element(unique element).

    2. document.getElementByClassName(""); - used to select an html element based on its class attribute.

    3. document.getElementByName(""); - used to select an html element based on their tag names.

    4. document.getElementByTagName(""); - used to select an html element based on their name attributes.

    - these below methods  used to select html elements based on CSS selectors.

    6. document.querySelector(); - use # for IDs and . for classes 
    5. document.querySelectorAll(); -  use # for IDs and . for classes
