Give me some idea on what is a Data type. What are Primitive Data types and Non-Primitive Data types. Explain with some examples.

Datatype: 
    A datatype is an attribute that identifies a variable and instructs the machine on how to precess and compile it.

Primitive Datatypes:
    These datatypes are immutable and can only store single values at a time.
    Types of primitive datatypes include:
        1. Number
        2. String
        3. Boolean
        4. Undefined
        5. Null
        6. Big int
        7. Symbol etc..

    => Number: Represents both integer and floating-point values, including positive and negative values, such as 42 or 3.14.
    
    => String: Represents a sequence of characters, enclosed in single or double quotes, like "hello world".
    
    => Boolean:   true or false.
    
    => Undefined: A variable that has been declared but not assigned a value, representing an unknown or uninitialized state.
    
    => Null: absence of any object or just empty space.
    
    => Big int: stores large integers that cannot be represented by the Number type, used for values larger than 2^53 - 1.


Non - primitive Datatypes:
    These are the datatypes that are mutable and can store more than one value ata single time.
    Types of non - primitive datatypes include:
        1. Class 
        2. Object 
        3. Array 
        4. Function 
        5. Map and Set etc...

    => Class: A blueprint for creating objects, defining properties and methods to be shared by all instances of the class.
    
    => Object: A collection of properties and methods, where properties are key-value pairs, or basically known as "an instance of a class".
    
    => Array: An ordered collection of elements, which can hold only a single datatype of elements at a single time.
    
    => Function: A block of code designed to perform a specific task, generally, used for running more than once.
    
    => Map and Set: A Map stores key-value pairs, where keys are unique, while a Set stores unique values with no particular order.
